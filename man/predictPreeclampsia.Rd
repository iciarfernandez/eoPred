\usage{
predictPreeclampsia(betas, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{betas}{matrix or array of methylation values on the beta scale (0, 1),
where the variables are arranged in rows, and samples in columns.}
}
\value{
produces a list with components detailed in the `mixOmics::predict`
}
\description{
Uses 45 CpGs to predict early preeclampsia (PE delivered before or at 34 weeks of gestation)
on placental DNA methylation microarray data.
}
\details{
Assigns the class labels "early-PE" or "normotensive" to each sample
and returns a class probability.

It is recommended that users apply beta-mixture quantile normalization (BMIQ) to their data
prior to prediction. This was the normalization method used on the training data.
